This time we set a new attendance record –</span><strong>495 guests &nbsp</strong><span>, not counting the &nbsp</span><strong>numerous sponsors and members of their families.</strong></p><p class="mb">Museum was filled with laughter and the atmosphere was charged with happiness and everyone’s good mood. Though all the museum rooms were filled, every child had an opportunity to participate in something fun, wise, kind and helpful. Including, of course, the exhibition of Marc Chagall, which was interesting for adults as well.  As always, all the visitors of our event participated in the lottery drawing.</p><p style="font-weight:700" class="mb">Oh, I almost forgot!
